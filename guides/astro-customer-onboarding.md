Welcome to Astronomer. You might be here because you're our newest customer, or because you're wondering what working with Astronomer would look like for your team. 

To help you hit the ground running, this guide will walk you through what you need to know and do to get started as an Astronomer Customer. 

# What You Get

In case you already forgot, here's a breakdown of what you get with each of our two products. 

## Astronomer: Cloud Edition

Astronomer Cloud gives you:

- A managed instance of Apache Airflow on an Astronomer-hosted cluster for ultimate abstraction from all-things infrastructure

- A custom CLI for easy DAG deployment and management

- Access to our Astronomer UI with secure authentication for easy deployment, user, and workspace management ([read more here](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/app-ui/))

- Resource Controls (soon adjustable directly through the Astronomer UI)

- Enteprise-level support from a group of Airflow aficionados dedicated to keep your workflows up and running (get in touch with us for pricing details)


## Astronomer: Enterprise Edition

Astronomer Enterprise allows you to run a private version of our platform on your own Kubernetes.

You get:

- Astronomer Command Center that includes an Astronomer-built UI, CLI, and a GraphQL API for easy cluster and deployment management on Kubernetes

- Access to our Prometheus and Grafana monitoring stack

- Enterprise Authentication that supports Google Suite, SAML, Office 365, Active Directory, and more

- A dedicated Astronomer support team (additional cost)

Read [here](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/astronomer-features/) for more details on each of these components. 


# Getting Started

Ready to get hit the ground running? Here's a breakdown of immediate next steps. 

## Astronomer: Cloud Edition

#### Step 1: Create a Workspace
- Go here: https://app.astronomer.cloud/

- Once you're there, this guide will walk you through deployment, CLI installation, image customization etc. as well as give you a short list of tips and gotchas you can watch out for.

#### Step 2: Follow this Guide

- Once you've created a workspace, [this](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/getting-started-with-new-cloud/) guide will walk you through the rest (CLI installation,deployment, DAG migration, etc.)

## Astronomer: Enterprise Edition

We have a collection of guides, depending on the cloud you're working on. To get started, find yours below:

- [Astronomer on Amazon Web Services - EKS](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/install-aws/)

- [Astronomer on Google Cloud Platform - GKE](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/install-gcp/)

# Astronomer Support

Need some help troubleshooting and not sure where to turn? Here are a few things you can rely on:

## Astronomer Team

Our team of Data Engineers are here to help. For all-things support, we currently have 3 offerings:

### (1) General Support (Free)

- Generally, if you run into a one-off technical issue, you can file a support ticket by shooting an email to **support@astronomer.io**. You can expect to hear back from us within 24 hours (usually sooner).

- If you have a specific feature request or are curious about platform-wide issues our engineering team is tackling, you can track and open up issues in this repo

### (2) Slack Channel Support (Paid)

- If you're looking for 1:1 attention from us, we've found that a private, shared slack channel between our two teams is very much worth the cost. We'll walk you through troubleshooting in real-time, hop on a screenshare if necessary, and share insights, gotchas and best practices that other customers might not get easy access to

- If you're interested in this option, reach out to our Head of Sales, Brad Kirn (brad@astronomer.io)

### (3) Astronomer SpaceCamp

SpaceCamp is our Apache Airflow training and education program for teams looking to run Airflow at scale. (Think: We come to your office for a few days, and get your team ramped up on Airflow).

For more info, check out [this](https://www.astronomer.io/spacecamp/) page, or fill out [this](https://www.astronomer.io/spacecamp/#request-spacecamp) interest form to chat with us.
