## Overview

[Apache Airflow Sensors](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/sensors.html) are a special kind of operator that are designed to wait for something to happen. When they run, they will check to see if a certain criteria is met before they complete and let their downstream tasks execute.
