2019 may just be the year of [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow). Since the project started at Airbnb in 2014, adoption for Airflow as a reliable and scalable scheduler has grown quickly while parallel offerings like [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/) have slowed in development and adoption.

Astronomer was born from that need and in 2018 [announced Astronomer Enterprise](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/announcing-astronomer-enterprise-edition/) - a self-hosted Airflow management solution. We've since also developed [Astronomer Cloud](https://astronomer.io/cloud), a fully-managed Airflow solution for those looking to stay abstracted from all-things DevOps.

That same year, Google announced their entry into the market with [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer/), a parallel "Airflow as a Service" offering.

While we're incredibly excited that the commercialization of the Apache Airflow project is growing, we want to guide users deciding betweeen Astronomer and Composer as their managed Airflow service of choice. Read below for a thorough comparison of both offerings.

**Note**: As you might expect, weâ€™re not heavy users of Composer and this comparison is derived from a combination of customer feedback and what we could find in public documentation and associated online communities (e.g. StackOverflow, Slack, etc.) at the time of writing. If anything appears incorrect or misleading, reach out to us at humans@astronomer.io and we'll work with you to adjust relevant content.

### Cost

#### Google Cloud Composer

It's hard to land on a specific cost for Cloud Composer, as Google measures the resources your deployments use and adds the total cost of your Airflow deployments onto your wider GCP bill.

Based on the [estimates provided](https://cloud.google.com/composer/pricing), a single, full-time instance of Composer:

- Costs ~$300/month
- Assumes that all 3 workers use the relatively low-powered `n1-standard-1` (1 vCPU; 3.75GB) machine type
- Does not include Storage and Compute Engine costs

#### Astronomer

Astronomer Cloud is billed based on exact resources used per deployment. On Astronomer, you're free to ajust resource allocation to each Airflow component (Scheduler, Webserver and Celery Workers) to best fit both your budget and use case.

Based on our default resource allocation, it breaks down to:

- $110/mo for a default deployment with Airflow's Local Executor
- $250/mo for a default deployment with the Celery Executor
- $290/mo for a default deployment with the Kubernetes Executor

On Astronomer Cloud v0.11, the node limits for any single task (based on Google's standard-16 machine type) are:

- 58 GB of Memory/RAM
- 15 CPU

For more details, check out our [pricing doc](https://astronomer.io/docs/pricing).

Astronomer Enterprise is priced based on an annual subscription license. Please [contact us](https://astronomer.io/contact) if you'd like to see a pricing sheet.

### System Packages

#### Astronomer

Astronomer's base Airflow images are [Alpine-based](https://alpinelinux.org/about/) (a distribution of Linux), which we leverage for its small size and resource efficiency (3.98MB)

With that said, we've recently published a Debian image in v0.11. Despite its larger size (123MB), we want our users to have the option for better package dependency compatibility.

All of our Docker Images are open-sourced and can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/astronomerinc/ap-airflow/). Source code for them [here](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer/tree/release-0.7/docker/airflow).

For a more in-depth comparison (and how this translates to cost when deployed to a cloud that charges for transfer cost), check out this [great post](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/the-3-biggest-wins-when-using-alpine-as-a-base-docker-image) by Nick Janetakis.

### Deployment

Both Astronomer and Composer currently use a fairly similar setup for executing tasks. Each Airflow component (Webserver, Scheduler, and Workers) are deployed as pods on Kubernetes using the Celery Executor. The largest difference in deployment between Astronomer and Cloud Composer is where these pods run.

#### Astronomer

While Google Cloud Composer only runs on Google's Cloud Platform, Astronomer Cloud runs on a [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)cluster fully managed and hosted by the Astronomer team.

Astronomer Enterprise is entirely Cloud agnostic and can be installed on any Kubernetes Cluster. We recommend using a managed Kubernetes service from any of the large cloud providers ([Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/), [Pivotal PKS](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service), and [GCP GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)), but you'd be equally able to run our platform on any flavor of on-prem Kubernetes.

### Monitoring and Logging

**Google Cloud Composer**

As of the [1.0.0 release](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/release-notes#july_19_2018_composer-100-airflow-190), logging in Composer is handled by Stackdriver and based on [fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org). Metrics availlable in [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/managing/monitoring-environments). As of [the March 31, 2020](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/release-notes#March_31_2020), Google added [monitoring dashboard](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/monitoring-dashboard). 

**Astronomer**

Logging in Astronomer is handled by [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

Astronomer Cloud leverages a few features on the logging and metrics front. 

#### 1. Real-time Scheduler, Webserver, Worker Logs

Astronomer pulls searchable, real-time logs from your Airflow Scheduler, Webserver, and Workers directly into the Astronomer UI.

![logging](https://assets2.astronomer.io/main/guides/logging.png)

#### 2. Deployment Level Metrics

As of Astronomer v0.9, we've also pulled a variety of deployment level metrics into the Astronomer UI, including:

- Container status
- Deployment health
- Task success and failure rates
- CPU and Memory usage
- Database connections

![logging](https://assets2.astronomer.io/main/blog/metrics.gif)

#### 3. Cluster Wide Metrics (*Enterprise only*)

Astronomer Enterprise offers the same logging and metrics features incorporated in Astronomer Cloud but also comes with access to a Grafana/Prometheus monitoring stack (the basis for the deployment level metrics above) to keep an eye on health and metadata *across* Airflow deployments.

### Airflow Executor Support

#### Google Cloud Composer

Google Cloud Composer supports the Celery Executor only.

#### Astronomer

As of v0.9, Astronomer supports the Kubernetes Executor. While it's not scale-to-zero to start with, that's most certainly a reality we're working towards.

To read more, refer to [Airflow Executors: Explained](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/airflow-executors-explained/).

### Support and Training

#### Google Cloud Composer

Google Cloud offers different support packages to meet different needs, such as 24/7 coverage, phone support, and access to a technical support manager. For more information, see [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support).

Google Cloud offers Hands-on training via [QwikiLabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) which allow you to get to know Cloud Composer and other tools for your daily work as a Data Enginner, including Dataproc, BigQuery and more.

[Google Cloud certifications](https://cloud.google.com/certification) allows you to validate your expertise and show your ability to transform businesses with Google Cloud technology.

For the most demanding, [Google Consoluting Services](https://cloud.google.com/consulting) provides access to Google Cloud experts to build the solution your business needs.

It's also provide community-based support. Users can post questions to forums like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-cloud-composer) or use the [https://googlecloud-community.slack.com/](Google Cloud Slack community). For Cloud Composer, they have join the [#composer](https://googlecloud-community.slack.com/messages/C7DGV8DGQ/) channel.

#### Astronomer

Astronomer's support automatically gives your team access to it's team of Airflow experts. Weâ€™ve been using Airflow internally for 2+ years and have helped many companies improve their data processes using Airflow.

Astronomer has both of Airflow release managers on staff and several of its core committers who are constantly working to improve the core OSS project, and offer on-site product agnostic Airflow trainings ([SpaceCamp](https://www.astronomer.io/spacecamp/))
