Astronomer Enterprise allows you to run a private version of our platform on your own Kubernetes.

It includes:

- Astronomer Command Center that includes an Astronomer-built UI, CLI, and a GraphQL API for easy cluster and deployment management on Kubernetes

- Access to our Prometheus and Grafana monitoring stack

- Enterprise Authentication that supports Google Suite, SAML, Office 365, Active Directory, and more

- Enterprise-grade business day or business critical support

Read [here](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/astronomer-features/) for more details on each of these components.
